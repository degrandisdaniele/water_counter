# Mechanical Counter Web App

This is a simple web application that simulates a mechanical counter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is built with Vite and can be deployed to Heroku.

## Features

- Displays a 6-digit counter.
- Digits visually "rotate" as the counter increments every second.
- Styled to resemble a classic mechanical counter.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the counter.
- `main.js`: Implements the counter logic and animation.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration file.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.
- `Procfile`: Heroku process file.
- `dist/`: Directory where the production build is stored (generated by `npm run build`).

## Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will usually open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## Building for Production

To create a production build (outputs to the `dist` folder):

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment to Heroku

This app is configured for Heroku deployment.

1.  **Create a Heroku app (if you don't have one):**
    Follow the instructions on the [Heroku Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps).

2.  **Set up Heroku Git remote (if not already set up):**
    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name
    ```

3.  **Deploy to Heroku:**
    Make sure your changes are committed to your Git repository.
    ```bash
    git push heroku main
    ```
    (Or your default branch if it's not `main`)

    Heroku will use the `Procfile` and the `start` script in `package.json` to run the application using the `serve` package to serve the static files from the `dist` directory.

## Environment Variables

This application does not require specific environment variables for its basic operation as a client-side counter. If extended with backend features, environment variables might be needed (e.g., for API keys or database URLs).
## Controlling Rotation Speed

The application allows you to control the speed at which the counter digits update (and thus rotate).

-   **Update Interval (ms):** In the control panel below the counter, you will find an input field labeled "Update Interval (ms)".
-   Enter the desired time in milliseconds (e.g., 1000 for 1 second, 500 for half a second) for how often the counter should increment.
-   **Set Speed Button:** Click the "Set Speed" button to apply the new interval.

The default interval is 1000ms (1 second).
